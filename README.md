# Module 2 | Project: Sportsharing

## Introduction

Module 2 is focused on learning the Backend Framework.</br>
Project 2 aim is to create and present a full-stack app having users and all CRUD operations and being deployed to Heroku.</br>

For this we used the following technologies which we had acquired during this Module: 
- Node.js (especially Express.js),
- MongoDB & Mongoose, 
- Handlebars, 
- Axios.

## Pitch:

Sportsharing is the web application where people can organize sport events with other sport enthusiasts.

- You want to exercise in a flexible way?
- You want to do sports in group, but your friends are not motivated?
- You want to discover new sports?
